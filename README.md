## K-Map Solver Web Application
The K-Map Solver Web Application is a college project aimed at simplifying and optimizing Boolean algebra expressions using Karnaugh Maps. This project is developed using a combination of technologies, including C for the backend logic and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend user interface.

Still at the developing stage......

## Features
* Interactive Interface: The frontend interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to interact with Karnaugh Maps and input truth values.
* Backend Logic: The backend of the application is implemented in C and handles the core logic of simplifying Boolean expressions based on Karnaugh Maps.
* Automated Simplification: The backend logic processes user inputs and generates simplified Boolean expressions using the K-Map solving algorithm.

## How to Use
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Set up an Apache web server with CGI support and configure the necessary directories.
* Place the C CGI script in the appropriate directory and ensure it has execute permissions.
* Create a directory for your frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and configure the Apache server to serve them.
* Access the application through your local web browser by navigating to the appropriate URLs.

## Note
This project is intended for educational purposes and as a demonstration of integrating C programming with web technologies. It is not meant for deployment on the internet.
